# University DAO

  

University DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) designed to revolutionize the way universities decide their course curriculums. This application empowers colleges to collaboratively vote on course curriculums for university students, ensuring inclusivity and collective decision-making. Students can visit the application to view the finalized curriculums in real-time.

  

The application is built on the Mantle Sepolia Testnet, leveraging blockchain technology for transparency, security, and decentralization.

  

## Features

  

-  **Decentralized Voting**: Colleges can propose and vote on course curriculums.

-  **Transparent Process**: All votes and decisions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency.

-  **Student Access**: Students can easily access the selected course curriculums.
- **Mantle Integration**: Smart Contract is deployed on Mantle sepolia testnet.
